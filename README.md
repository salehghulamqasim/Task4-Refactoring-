## Project Overview

This project is a blog template that was built to demonstrate best practices in web design, layout, and UX/UI principles. The project is divided into a main content area displaying articles, a sidebar with recent posts and an about section, and a footer with a copyright message. Additionally, the design is mobile responsive, making it adaptable to various screen sizes.

## Features Added

1. **Back to Top Button**:  
   A button that appears once the user scrolls down the page, allowing them to quickly navigate back to the top of the page.

2. **Responsive Navigation Menu**:  
   A mobile-friendly navigation bar that collapses on smaller screens and can be toggled using a hamburger menu icon.

3. **Contact Form in Footer**:  
   A simple contact form added to the footer that allows users to reach out with inquiries.

## Before and After Changes

### Before:
- The blog had a basic layout with a header, articles, a sidebar, and a footer.
- It lacked any interactive features, such as a back-to-top button or a responsive navigation menu.
- The footer only displayed a copyright message without any user interaction options.

### After:
- A **Back to Top Button** was added, making navigation more efficient for users who have scrolled down a long page.
- The **navigation menu** was enhanced to be responsive, so it adjusts for smaller screen sizes (such as mobile devices).
- A **contact form** was added to the footer, allowing visitors to get in touch directly through the blog.
- Minor CSS improvements were made to ensure the blog looked great across all screen sizes.

## How It Works

### Back to Top Button:
- The button becomes visible when the user scrolls down the page.
- When clicked, it smoothly scrolls the page back to the top using JavaScript.

### Responsive Navigation Menu:
- The navigation bar contains links to "Home," "About," "Contact," and "Portfolio."
- On smaller screens, the navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu that can be toggled open/closed with JavaScript.

### Contact Form:
- The form contains input fields for name, email, and a message.
- It currently does not have back-end functionality but can be integrated with server-side technologies for form submission.
